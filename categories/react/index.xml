      <description>This tutorial will cover the basics of creating a minimal React app which can be deployed as a statically-linked Rust binary. What this accomplishes is having all of your code, including HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Rust, packaged into a single file that will run on pretty much any 64-bit Linux system, regardless of the kernel version or installed libraries.
Complete source is available on GitHub.
Why?  Simpler deployment: Having a static binary means you just have to copy the file to your servers and run it.</description>
